# react-apollo-pokemon

## So what is this about?
I want to brush up my react skills and also learn a thing or two about Apollo GraphQL.

## Brain dump:

Images: https://cdn.traction.one/pokedex/pokemon/3.png
API: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2

### MVP:
* support 151 pokemons
* show a random one
* dashboard having all of them by rows
* having deeplinkable profile page per pokemon (showing a single pokemon image, name, and other stats provided by the api)
* user wants to keep track of which he already caught

... use ApolloGraphQL as learning experience
... also TypeScript
